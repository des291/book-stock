# The Book Oasis

My solution for the Aviva coding challenge.

An app which provides functionality for the store owner to digitalise the books stocked by the store.

The app allows a user to:
- Add a new book.
- Retrieve information from the listing.
- Amend the listing.
- Remove a book.
- View all books.
